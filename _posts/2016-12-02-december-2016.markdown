The second issue of the 2016-2017 *Convergence* year, themed around "Esports": writers argue for and against esports in society and at our school, discuss the current business ventures around the topic, and how it ties into school spirit. In addition, writers explore overcommitting at the school, the TFC soccer club, interviews with the Winter Sports teams, and a timely issue of the Blazer.
